# Retrieving Data Constraint Implementations Using Fine-Grained Code Patterns - Replication Package

## Contents

1. [baseline-calibration](./baseline-calibration): Results of calibration tests for baselines. We evaluated the best constraint input for Lucene and LSI, and additionally the dimension parameter for LSI.

2. [data](./data): Source code, textual artifacts, and 299 constraints for the 15 target systems.

3. [results](./results): Full study results.

4. [stopwords.txt](./stopwords.txt): List of stopwords used by both Lasso-13 instances for preprocessing the textual fields of constraints and ESCs.
